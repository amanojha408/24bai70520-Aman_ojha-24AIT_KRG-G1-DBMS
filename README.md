# README – DBMS Practical Experiment 2
1. Experiment

Experiment No: 2
Title: SQL SELECT Queries using WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY

2. Aim of the Session

The aim of this practical session is to understand and implement SQL SELECT queries using different clauses such as WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for efficient data retrieval and analysis from relational database tables.

3. Objective of the Session

The objectives of this practical session are:

To practice writing SQL SELECT queries

To apply filtering conditions using the WHERE clause

To group records using GROUP BY

To apply conditions on grouped data using HAVING

To sort query results using ORDER BY

To understand the use of aggregate functions like AVG()

4. Practical / Experiment Steps

Create an EMPLOYEE table with appropriate attributes

Insert sample employee records into the table

Filter employees having salary greater than 20,000

Calculate average salary department-wise

Display only those departments whose average salary is greater than 30,000

Sort the result in descending order of average salary

5. Procedure of the Experiment

(i) Start the system and log in to the computer.
(ii) Open the database application (Oracle XE / PgAdmin).
(iii) Create or select the required database.
(iv) Create the EMPLOYEE table using SQL commands.
(v) Insert required records into the table.
(vi) Write the SQL SELECT query using WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses.
(vii) Execute the SQL commands one by one.
(viii) Verify the output obtained.
(ix) Save the work and take screenshots for record.
